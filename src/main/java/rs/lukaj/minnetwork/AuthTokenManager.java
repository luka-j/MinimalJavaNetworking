/**
 * Provides the interface for interacting with the tokens which identify user currently logged in.
 * Tokens are unique Strings, and any attempt to tamper them will result in server rejecting them.
 * Tokens are provided by the server upon successful login or registration, as well as on refresh.
 * Tokens have limited lifespan and need to be refreshed periodically, which is handled by Network
 * class. Class representing a User can be made to implement this interface, or it can be detached
 * from it. Persist the token somewhere, e.g. in SharedPreferences in order to avoid bothering the
 * user and minimize the need for unnecessary logins. I love how this doc is so perfectly aligned.
